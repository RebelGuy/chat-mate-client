# Streamer Guide (Minecraft Mod)

This document is intended as a guide for streamers wishing to use ChatMate to enhance their streaming experience. For information on how to get started with ChatMate, refer to the generic [Streamer Guide](https://github.com/RebelGuy/chat-mate/blob/master/docs/streamer-guide.md).

## Getting set up

ChatMate offers a free Minecraft mod that integrates your livestream into Minecraft and allows you to perform administration tasks, such as banning users and managing ranks. **Currently, the mod runs only on Minecraft Java Edition 1.8.9 and has not been tested with other popular mods, such as LabyMod or Lunar Client.** You can download the mod [here](https://github.com/RebelGuy/chat-mate-client/releases/latest).

To start, ensure you have followed the [instructions for setting up your account and stream](https://github.com/RebelGuy/chat-mate/blob/master/docs/streamer-guide.md). Install Minecraft Forge, and place the ChatMate `.jar` into your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Open the ChatMate Dashboard within Minecraft to log in to your ChatMate account. Once logged in, you have access to streamer features.
