The ChatMate mod uses the locally run `chat-mate-server` as an interface to get near real-time YouTube livestream chat messages. Messages are displayed in Minecraft chat.

# Project Details

This project was initialised using the `ForgeTemplate` repository for 1.8.9.

Before starting, ensure the latest JRE from https://www.java.com/en/download/ is installed (fixes :applyBinaryPatches error). If, at any point, something goes wrong during setup, the workspace can be reset with `gradlew clean cleanCache --refresh-dependencies` (fixes :fixMcSources error). Alternatively, the Gradle cache can be manually deleted under `C:\Users\<User>\.gradle`. If some files are locked for being in use, task-kill "Open JDK Platform Binary" and end the "java.exe" process from the Resource Monitor -> CPU section.

If, at any point, there is a Java version error when running a Gradle task, run the task within IntelliJ instead of CMD.

The Java 8 JDK (for building) and Java 17 JDK (for development) must be installed.
https://adoptium.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot
- Ensure JAVA_HOME is not set in either the user or system environment variables
- Ensure both the Java 17 and Java 8 `\bin` paths are set in the system environment `Path` variable
- Under Project Structure -> Platform Settings -> SDKs add the JDK home path to the Java 17 JDK folder - **failing to do so may cause IntelliJ to freeze upon project setup**
- Ensure the default IntelliJ Java version is Java 8 (File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Project -> SDK -> Choose 1.8/Java 8).

 **Once IntelliJ had set up the project workspace**, the command  `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` for setting up the environment (which includes a decompilation of Minecraft - if this is not desired, use `gradlew setupDevWorkspace` instead). Next, `gradlew genIntellijRuns` was run for generating the Gradle tasks. Note that the Gradle Java version was manually set in the `gradle.properties` file by adding the line `java.import.gradle.java.home=C:/Program Files/Eclipse Adoptium/jdk-8.0.312.7-hotspot` (the same folder as the default Project SDK picked in the step above). Furthermore, the `gradle-wrapper.properties` distribution URL was set to `distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.8.3-all.zip`.

If developing in VSCode, may need to first open the project in IntelliJ to generate all required files. Install the `Extension Pack for Java` and `Gradle for Java` extensions and make sure the 1.8/Java 8 folder is set in the `org.eclipse.buildship.core.prefs` file under `java.home`.

## File Encoding
In order to allow characters such as `'ยง'`, Java files must be encoding using UTF8, and the Java VM must be told of this.
- In the IntelliJ settings, set global and project encodings to UTF8
- In the system environment variables, add `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` with value `-Dfile.encoding=UTF8` (see [explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/361975/setting-the-default-java-character-encoding))

## Building
To build the project, use `gradlew build`.

Build output: `chat-mate-client/build/libs/*.jar`.

Debug partial .minecraft folder: `chat-mate-client/run/`

## Custom Chat
We use a custom implementation of the `GuiNewChat` gui object (this is what renders the chat lines,
handles `IChatComponents`, etc). There is a couple of points to note on how this works:

The `GuiIngame` object (this is what renders all the overlay components such as chat, health bar, etc) holds its own
private final version of the `GuiNewChat`, which it uses internally, and exposes publicly via `GetChatGUI()`.

Forge has
its own implementation (`GuiIngameForge`) which it uses to fire overlay rendering events. Conveniently, the `GuiIngame`
object is used only as a public settable property of `Minecraft`. So we can simply set `Minecraft.guiIngame`
to `CustomGuiIngame extends GuiIngameForge` and override the `GetChatGUI()` so that it returns our
own `CustomGuiNewChat` instead. Calling `Minecraft.guiIngame.GetChatGUI()` from anywhere will now return our custom
implementation. **Important**: We have to wait to instantiate `CustomGuiIngame` until AFTER the Minecraft object has
completely loaded because it has a getter that returns null initially, which some overlay renderers rely on.
Also, We have to wait until right after all mods have been loaded to be able to set `Minecraft.guiIngame`, otherwise
Forge will overwrite it (it instantiates this class very late in the intialisation cycle).

Now, by listening to the chat render events fired by `GuiIngameForge`, we can prevent its default
behaviour (i.e. `cancel` the event) and use `CustomGuiNewChat.drawChat()` instead. As a result, the `GuiIngameForge`
never has a chance to interact with its private `GuiNewChat` object (which remains to be the default implementation).
